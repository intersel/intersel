- 👋 Hi, I’m @intersel, a web agency in Paris where we create websites and webapps
- 👀 I’m interested in Modx, Livinweb, project management, Tennis, dramatic arts and lots of other things ;)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects requiring a 'nocode' approach where we could use our [Livinweb solution](https://www.livinweb.fr) that is based on [ModX](https://modx.com/)
- 📫 You can reach me at contact@intersel.fr
